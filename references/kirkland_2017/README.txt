5 r scripts

mayors_source.R

All r scripts depend on the function definitions in mayors_source.R. The r scripts depend on the .rdata versions of the data.

This replication creates all figures and tables in the text. All figures and tables are stored as r objects.  If users wish to export them, we suggest ggsave() for the figures and xtable() for the tables.
